I'm currently a PhD student in [Mathematics Department](http://www.math.ust.hk/) of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I work with [Cai Jianfeng](https://www.math.ust.hk/~jfcai/), and my nice advisors are [Wang Yang](https://www.math.ust.hk/~yangwang/) and [Yao Yuan](https://www.math.ust.hk/people/faculty/profile/yuany/). [CV](https://gitipanda.github.io/cv/)

My research interest lies in efficient and provable algorithms for industrial and mathematical problems, landscape and geometric analysis of non-convex problems, deep learning theory, with theoretical guarantee that may based on optimization, probability and random matrix tools. See more on [Research Interests](https://gitipanda.github.io/markdown/).
