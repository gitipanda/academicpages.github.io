<span style="font-size:18pt;">**李珍珍(Li, Zhenzhen)**</span>

I'm currently a CMX postdoc in the Computational and Mathematical Science Department of California Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Thomas Yizhao Hou. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. ‪Jian-Feng Cai‬. More details can be found in my [CV](https://gitipanda.github.io/cv/).

I'm broadly interested in machine learning problems. My research interest lies in efficient and provable algorithms for industrial and mathematical problems, low-rank and sparse structured matrix related problems, non-convex optimization, manifold optimization, feature learning, etc.
