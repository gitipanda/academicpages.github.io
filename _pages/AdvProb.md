In compressed sensing and high dimensional data science, isometric embedding plays an crucial role which lay its foundation upon non-asymptotical analysis of random matrices. It can be dated back to 1990s, Bai-yin law state that:...... More precisely,....

Covering Nets technique: to get uniformly bound (usually operator bound or uniformly for $S^{n-1}$), one can use $\epsilon$-Net to help establish such. More precisely, the uniform bound for all $S^{n-1}$ can be in the same order of bounds for $\epsilon$-Net. So in each point in the epsilon Net, we have a bound and a fail probability, we can have the uniform bound for all points in the $\epsilon$-Net and union fail probability(fail probability for each point times $\epsilon$-Net size).
