<span style="font-size:18pt;">**Experience**</span>
* Mar 2021: MS71 Computational Linear Algebra in Data Analysis
  * SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, Zoom
  
* Dec 2019: CMX seminar
  * CMS, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, US

* Jul 2019: Oral presentation
  * International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Universitat de València, Spain
  
* June 2017: Phase Retrieval: Theory, Application and Algorithms
  * ICERM, Brown University, US

* Apr 2017 - Dec 2017: Wechat Laboratory
  * Project: We collaborated with the Wechat laboratory and helped them solve real-time video denoising problems. In details, we used wavelet tools to establish a noise level detection function and used a data-driven dictionary learning method to do the denoising task. I played a major role in the algorithm design and writing the algorithm package with C++. This work was conducted in Hong Kong, China.
  
* Summer 2014: Modeling Researcher
  * HUAXI Futures Company
  * Project: My duty was to develop quantitative trading strategies and my strategy was used practically in real trading models. This work was conducted in Chengdu, China.
