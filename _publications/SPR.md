title: " Working Paper: Sparse Phase Retrieval Under Optimal Sampling with Local Guarantee"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/SPR
excerpt: 'This is my current working paper focus on retrieving sparse signals under optimal sampling complexity. We design an algorithm for sparse phase retrieval and would provide theoretical guarantee for such algorithm, which would be the first practical local algorithm with theoretical guarantee for sparse phase retrieve. Although we may need an good initialization in latter work, we think this at least provide a great first step to such sparse phase retrieval open problem.lalallala'
